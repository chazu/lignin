Design Graph\n- DAG structure for primitives, transforms, and joins\n- Node identity stability (UUIDs? content-addressed?)\n- Immutable graph operations\n- Node-to-source expression mapping\n\n### 2. Part System\n- Named part reference mechanism\n- Grain direction representation (X/Y/Z dominant axis?)\n- Part metadata (intended dimensions, material)\n- Parts that emit multiple solids vs single solids\n\n### 3. Join Semantics\n- Butt joint specification (which face of part A joins which face of part B)\n- Clearance/tolerance model (per joint or global?)\n- Hole drilling operations (how to specify position/orientation)\n- Fastener embedding (screws - position, diameter, depth)\n\n## Deliverables\n- Design graph schema (Go struct definitions)\n- Part naming and reference API\n- Join operation specification format\n- Example: design graph for a simple box with 2 parts joined\n- Validation rules (what constitutes valid vs invalid graph)\n\n## Key Constraints\n- No module/import system for MVP\n- Stock mapping is advisory only (not required)\n- Must support progressive refinement (abstract → concrete)","notes":"Implemented: \n- Created comprehensive architecture design document (ARCHITECTURE.md)\n- Implemented core graph data structures with content-addressed node IDs\n- Built PartRegistry for part naming and reference API with unique name enforcement\n- Designed join semantics with butt joints, holes, fasteners, and woodworking-specific joins\n- Created GraphBuilder and DesignBuilder fluent APIs for programmatic construction\n- Implemented validation system with cycle detection and comprehensive rule checking\n- Added example of simple box design with 8 parts and 8 butt joints\n- Wrote unit tests covering all data structures and API functions\n- All deliverables completed: graph schema, part API, join format, example, validation rules","status":"hooked","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"lignin/polecats/shiny","owner":"chazbone@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-02T19:28:04.226486-05:00","created_by":"lignin/crew/chazu","updated_at":"2026-02-02T20:41:14.085361-05:00","labels":["research"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"li-ac3","depends_on_id":"li-wisp-yqa","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-02T20:41:13.740084-05:00","created_by":"lignin/crew/chazu"}]}
