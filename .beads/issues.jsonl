Design Graph\n- DAG structure for primitives, transforms, and joins\n- Node identity stability (UUIDs? content-addressed?)\n- Immutable graph operations\n- Node-to-source expression mapping\n\n### 2. Part System\n- Named part reference mechanism\n- Grain direction representation (X/Y/Z dominant axis?)\n- Part metadata (intended dimensions, material)\n- Parts that emit multiple solids vs single solids\n\n### 3. Join Semantics\n- Butt joint specification (which face of part A joins which face of part B)\n- Clearance/tolerance model (per joint or global?)\n- Hole drilling operations (how to specify position/orientation)\n- Fastener embedding (screws - position, diameter, depth)\n\n## Deliverables\n- Design graph schema (Go struct definitions)\n- Part naming and reference API\n- Join operation specification format\n- Example: design graph for a simple box with 2 parts joined\n- Validation rules (what constitutes valid vs invalid graph)\n\n## Key Constraints\n- No module/import system for MVP\n- Stock mapping is advisory only (not required)\n- Must support progressive refinement (abstract → concrete)","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","owner":"chazbone@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-02T21:01:34.705893-05:00","created_by":"chazu","updated_at":"2026-02-02T21:13:51.876905-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-02T21:13:51.876905-05:00","close_reason":"Closed","labels":["research"]}
